## What I Learned From this Project -
- DOM Manipulation: I learned how to interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) using JavaScript to dynamically manipulate the elements of a web page. This includes selecting and modifying HTML elements, changing their styles, adding or removing content, and handling events such as clicks or input changes.

- Creating and Reading Data: I learned how to create and read data within my notes website. By utilizing JavaScript, I was able to capture user input from forms, retrieve and display existing notes, and dynamically update the DOM to reflect changes.

 - Deleting Data: I learned how to implement  delete operations for my notes. With the knowledge of DOM manipulation, I was able to  delete notes from the DOM and the underlying data source.
